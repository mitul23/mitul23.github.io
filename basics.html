    <h3><em>About me</em></h3>
    <div class="me">
    <p>I just graduated with a masters in Theoretical Physics from the
    University of Manitoba, Winnipeg. I'm currently working as an Deep Learning
  Intern at the University of Winnipeg, as well work on some personal data
science projects in my spare time. I'm always curious to try my hands on new technologies.</p>

    <h3><em>Master's Research work</em></h3>
    <div class="msc">
    <p>As part of my masters research project, I did some work on the physics of the very early universe.
  Probably everyone has heard of the "Standarad Big Bang Theory", but what you don't know is that
the theory is incomplete. It says nothing about how the universe was born, how the univese is so large and
where did the seeds for the large-scale structures such as galaxies come from etc etc. An idea was developed back in 80's
to answer these questions, it's called "Inflation". The basic idea is that just after the universe was born, the univese expanded
by a tremendous factor known as inflation, which answers some of the questions that the big bang theory cannot.
My thesis was to build toy models of inflation from string theory.</p>

    <h3><em>Deep Learning Internship</em></h3>
    <div class="intern">
    <p>As part of my Internship, I'm working on the neutrino physics data collected in Japan. The task is to
develop Graph Neural Network (GNN) models on the geometry of the detector. The detector consists of photomultipler (mPMT) tubes.
There are approximately 12,000 mPMTs inside a cylindrical tube. The task is to first select number of mPMTs and connect it to 20 neighbouring mPMTs so in the end we
end up with many clusters of mPMTs each with 20 closest neighbors. One can view these as a graph with the location of mPMTs as nodes and connection between them as
edges. We will then assign physical quantities such as charge etc to the nodes as features and apply GNN's.</p>
